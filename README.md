# i-Park Launch Page & App Design

During The Bizz-Code challenge hosted by KPMG-Software Malta, my team and I managed to come up with a business plan for an application which aims to target the parking problem on the Maltese islands.

<ul>
  <p> <b><u>Within the file directory you will find:</u></b></p>
  <li>App mock-up found in pdf format (made with Invision)</li>
  <li>Launch page source code (js, html, css)</li>
</ul>
  
The mock-up was constructed by a UX student Noel D'anastasi & myself.
The pre-launch page was inspired by a template I had found online (https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/), and was changed to satisfy our needs for the presentation. 

Thanks to various components added to the presentation and 3 sleeples nights of hard-work, my team i-Park Solutions, managed to take home the prize, making the sacrifice well worth it!
